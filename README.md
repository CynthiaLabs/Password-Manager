# Password-Manager
Python password manager written by @DestinyOfYeet


## Installing dependencies

This was tested with python 3.10, so everything above it should work fine. 
I don't know how low you can go though.

To install the dependencies:

Windows:
```
py -m pip install requirements.txt
```

Linux:
```
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
```

## Run the password manager

Windows:
```
py password_manager.py
```

Linux:
```
python3 password_manager.py
```
